# Privacy & Client Confidentiality

**IMPORTANT READING FOR LEGAL PROFESSIONALS**

This document addresses privacy and confidentiality considerations when using this Tool, with particular attention to professional obligations under Costa Rican bar association rules.

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Risks:**
- Queries through Claude API flow via Anthropic cloud infrastructure
- Query content may reveal client matters and privileged information
- Costa Rican bar rules (Colegio de Abogados y Abogadas de Costa Rica) require strict confidentiality (secreto profesional) and data processing controls

**Safe Use Options:**
1. **General Legal Research**: Use Tool for non-client-specific queries
2. **Local npm Package**: Install `@ansvar/costa-rican-law-mcp` locally — database queries stay on your machine
3. **Remote Endpoint**: Vercel Streamable HTTP endpoint — queries transit Vercel infrastructure
4. **On-Premise Deployment**: Self-host with local LLM for privileged matters

## Data Flows and Infrastructure

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Architecture

This Tool uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to communicate with AI clients:

```
User Query -> MCP Client (Claude Desktop/Cursor/API) -> Anthropic Cloud -> MCP Server -> Database
```

### Deployment Options

#### 1. Local npm Package (Most Private)

```bash
npx @ansvar/costa-rican-law-mcp
```

- Database is local SQLite file on your machine
- No data transmitted to external servers (except to AI client for LLM processing)
- Full control over data at rest

#### 2. Remote Endpoint (Vercel)

```
Endpoint: https://costa-rican-law-mcp.vercel.app/mcp
```

- Queries transit Vercel infrastructure
- Tool responses return through the same path
- Subject to Vercel's privacy policy

### What Gets Transmitted

When you use this Tool through an AI client:

- **Query Text**: Your search queries and tool parameters
- **Tool Responses**: Statute text (textos legales), provision content, search results
- **Metadata**: Timestamps, request identifiers

**What Does NOT Get Transmitted:**
- Files on your computer
- Your full conversation history (depends on AI client configuration)

## Professional Obligations (Costa Rica)

### Costa Rican Bar Association Rules

Costa Rican lawyers (abogados y abogadas) are bound by strict confidentiality rules under the Código de Deberes Jurídicos, Morales y Éticos del Profesional en Derecho, and the organic law of the Colegio de Abogados y Abogadas de Costa Rica.

#### Secreto profesional (Professional Secrecy)

- All client communications are privileged
- Client identity may be confidential in sensitive matters
- Case strategy and legal analysis are protected
- Information that could identify clients or matters must be safeguarded
- Breach of confidentiality may result in disciplinary proceedings (procedimientos disciplinarios) before the Colegio de Abogados and potential criminal liability

### Costa Rican Data Protection Law (Ley 8968)

Under the **Ley de Protección de la Persona frente al Tratamiento de sus Datos Personales (Ley 8968)** and its regulations, when using services that process client data:

- You are the **Data Controller** (responsable de la base de datos)
- AI service providers (Anthropic, Vercel) may be **Data Processors** (encargados del tratamiento)
- A **Data Processing Agreement** may be required
- Ensure adequate technical and organizational measures
- The Agencia de Protección de Datos de los Habitantes (PRODHAB) oversees compliance

## Risk Assessment by Use Case

### LOW RISK: General Legal Research

**Safe to use through any deployment:**

```
Example: "What does Article 40 of the Costa Rican Labor Code say about working hours?"
```

- No client identity involved
- No case-specific facts
- Publicly available legal information

### MEDIUM RISK: Anonymized Queries

**Use with caution:**

```
Example: "What are the penalties for tax evasion under Costa Rican law?"
```

- Query pattern may reveal you are working on a tax matter
- Anthropic/Vercel logs may link queries to your API key

### HIGH RISK: Client-Specific Queries

**DO NOT USE through cloud AI services:**

- Remove ALL identifying details
- Use the local npm package with a self-hosted LLM
- Or use official legal databases (SCIJ) with appropriate security controls

## Recommendations

### For Solo Practitioners / Small Firms (Abogados individuales / Bufetes pequeños)

1. Use local npm package for maximum privacy
2. General research: Cloud AI is acceptable for non-client queries
3. Client matters: Use official legal databases (SCIJ) and professional resources

### For Large Firms / Corporate Legal (Bufetes grandes / Departamentos jurídicos)

1. Negotiate Data Processing Agreements with AI service providers
2. Consider on-premise deployment with self-hosted LLM
3. Train staff on safe vs. unsafe query patterns

### For Government / Public Sector (Sector público)

1. Use self-hosted deployment, no external APIs
2. Follow Costa Rican government IT security requirements
3. Air-gapped option available for classified matters
